## Changes in this Version
The original PoseHelper has an issue where you cant really use n_hara as a root, it will result in weird results. This version gets rid of it by calculating based on the n_throw bone, wich is always in one place and normally not used. This fork is primairly for users of my Gpose and Animation rig.
